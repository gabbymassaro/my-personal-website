      <h3>A little about myself...</h3>
  
      <h4>Technical Background</h4>
      <p>
        My career in technology started about two years ago.
        I work in Software Quality Assurance as a Tester. 
      <p>
        Currently, I'm enjoying working with SQL. I've gotten a lot
        of hands on experience at Power! Data is really interesting and
        I find myself combing through our database quite a bit.
        This is in part due to the teams I test for; we support our Corporate 
        Finance division. Our focus is automating compensation
        and surfacing that data to users. We also maintain and optomize various
        domains within payroll, sales, and accounting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming languages include SQL, Java, Python, JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS. 
      </p>

      <h4>Career and Education History</h4>
      <p>
        Professionaly, I started working at an inpatient treatment
        facility for children. That was right after I graduated with
        my first Bachelor's in Psychology. I made the decision to
        switch careers and go back to school for Computer Science
        around 2018! 
      </p>

      <p>
        While working towards that degree, I found a stay in Private Tutoring, 
        working as the Education
        Coordinator for several C2 Education centers across 
        the greater Philadelphia area; as well as NJ and MD. 
      </p>  
      
      <p>
        Once graduated I from West Chester University with a second degree in CS,
        I was hired by Power Home Remodeling as a QA Tester. Now, I am
        applying to their Code Academy to learn how to be a Ruby Developer!
        I'm so excited for the opportunity to apply and potentially join
        Power as a future developer! I have never used Ruby before but I'm
        excited to learn :]

      <p>
        I think I'm two cats shy of cat-lady status 
        but these three little weirdos are mine:
