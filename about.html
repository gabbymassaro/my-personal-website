      <h4>Technical Background</h4>
      <p>
        My career in technology started about two years ago.
        It's been an exciting change. My previous career experiences
        are in Education and Youth and Family Counseling. Now, I work
        in Software Quality Assurance as a Tester. 
      <p>
        Currently, I'm enjoying working with SQL. I've gotten a lot
        of hands on experience at Power! Data is really interesting and
        I find myself combing through our database quite a bit.
        This is in part due to the teams I test for; we support our Corporate 
        Finance division. Our focus is automating compensation
        and surfacing that data to users. We also maintain and optomize various
        domains within payroll, sales, and accounting.

        Programming languages include SQL, Java, Python, JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS.
